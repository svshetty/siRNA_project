# siRNA_project
The project aimed at developing software for analyzing data generated from high-throughput genome-wide siRNA(silencing RNA) screens using R.  
Data was obtained from a study which used cells from five Ewings sarcoma cell lines plated on a 384 well plate and transfected with siRNAs from a library of commercial siRNA.  The final outcome in the study was cell viability, measured as a luminescence value corresponding to each well (each siRNA).  
Statistical analysis of this study involves producing quality metrics graphs, normalization of data and identification of “hits”. The software was developed in open source R statistical tool. The software intakes the data in user provided format and converts it into a format compatible with the cellHTS package which is a analysis package within R. The output includes quality metrics plots like histogram of intensities, MA plots, and correlation scatter plots between replicates. 
Normalization can be done using any of the options provided in the cellHTS package including robustZscore and Bscore. Further quality metrics assessing the overall quality of the assay including Z-factor and SSMD is also calculated. 
Finally, top ‘hits’, which identifies significant luminescence values is represented as the scored data in a ranked format. This software thus streamlines the process of analyzing immense volumes of high throughput screening data for statistical analysis.
